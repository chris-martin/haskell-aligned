Types from the Haskell [base](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base)
package, lined up to highlight their similarities.

Special thanks to:

* Christopher Allen and Julie Moronuki ([Haskell Programming from first principles](http://haskellbook.com/)) for the inspiration to start lining stuff up
* Gabriel Gonzalez ([The category design pattern](http://www.haskellforall.com/2012/08/the-category-design-pattern.html)) for the comparison of `(.)` to `(<=<)`
* Gabriel Lebec ([via Twitter](https://twitter.com/g_lebec/status/1223000501731708928)) for `fold`/`foldMap`, `sequenceA`/`traverse`, and `join`/`=<<`.
